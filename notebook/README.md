#  Notebook Folder

Welcome! This folder contains my **Python notebooks** and other work related to programming practice.

These notebooks were created as part of my coursework and lab exercises, where I practise and demonstrate the following:

- Python fundamentals
- Working with variables and data types
- Control flow (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, strings, and dictionaries
- Experimenting with examples from lectures
